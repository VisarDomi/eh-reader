## What this script does

This JavaScript project will allow you to:

- get all the images of the gallery of sad panda in one long strip format, without spaces
- the script assumes that the images 500 kB and your average internet speed is 8Mbs, which would be around 1 MB/s
- reload all images that do not load after 1 second by calling the reload button of sad panda
